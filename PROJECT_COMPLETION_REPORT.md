- **Logging Module**: Structured logging with levels, rotation, JSON support
- **Network Module**: Connectivity checks, retry logic, diagnostic functions  
- **Terminal Module**: Cross-platform terminal detection (macOS/Linux)
- **Session Manager**: Session lifecycle management (with bash 4.0+)
- **Claunch Integration**: Wrapper functions for claunch operations

#### ✅ Cross-Platform Compatibility
- **macOS**: Works with Homebrew bash 4.0+
- **Linux**: Native bash 4.0+ support on modern distributions
- **Dependencies**: Claude CLI, tmux, jq, curl detection working
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when dependencies missing

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL COMPATIBILITY REQUIREMENT

**IMPORTANT**: This system requires **bash 4.0 or higher** for full functionality.

### Compatibility Matrix
- ✅ **Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+, CentOS 7+)**: Native bash 4.0+ support
- ✅ **macOS with Homebrew bash**: Install with `brew install bash`
- ❌ **macOS default bash 3.2**: Limited functionality - requires upgrade
- ✅ **Modern Unix systems**: Generally compatible with bash 4.0+

### Technical Reason
The session management system uses associative arrays (`declare -A`) which were introduced in bash 4.0. This is fundamental to the architecture and cannot be easily worked around without significant performance penalties.
