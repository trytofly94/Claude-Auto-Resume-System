# Critical: Fix Module Dependency Issues for Live Deployment

**Created**: 2025-09-09
**Type**: Bug Fix / System Stability
**Estimated Effort**: Medium
**Related Issues**: GitHub #124 (CRITICAL), #127, #128
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Core functionality completely blocked

## Context & Goal

Fix critical module dependency issues that prevent core functionality from running. The hybrid-monitor.sh script fails with "load_system_config: command not found" error, completely blocking task automation and usage limit detection - the essential features needed for live deployment.

**Live Deployment Focus**:
- âœ… Core functionality: Task automation and usage limit detection BLOCKED
- âœ… Production readiness: Main program cannot run at all  
- âœ… Stability focus: Fixing critical system dependencies
- âœ… Avoid non-essentials: Focused only on making core features work

## Requirements
- [ ] Fix Issue #124: hybrid-monitor.sh fails due to missing config-loader import (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Fix Issue #127: setup-wizard.sh calls log_debug before sourcing logging module
- [ ] Fix Issue #128: Task queue modules have missing log function dependencies
- [ ] Implement systematic module dependency loading pattern
- [ ] Test core monitoring functionality without disrupting existing tmux sessions
- [ ] Ensure usage limit detection patterns work correctly

## Investigation & Analysis

### Current Critical State
**Issue #124 Status**: Despite previous scratchpad showing "COMPLETED", the issue persists:
```bash
./src/hybrid-monitor.sh: Zeile 235: load_system_config: Kommando nicht gefunden
[WARN] Failed to load configuration, using defaults  
[INFO] Hybrid monitor shutting down (exit code: 1)
```

**Impact Analysis**:
- ðŸ”´ **Core monitoring system**: Completely non-functional
- ðŸ”´ **Usage limit detection**: Cannot run
- ðŸ”´ **Task automation**: Blocked entirely
- ðŸ”´ **Live deployment**: Impossible without this fix

### Root Cause Analysis
From the error location (line 235 in hybrid-monitor.sh), the issue occurs in the configuration loading section. Based on prior investigation:

1. **Primary Issue**: Script calls `load_system_config` function without sourcing `src/utils/config-loader.sh`
2. **Secondary Issues**: Multiple scripts have similar dependency loading problems
3. **Systemic Problem**: Inconsistent module sourcing patterns across codebase

### Prior Work Investigation
- Previous scratchpad (2025-09-08) claimed this was fixed but issue persists
- Array optimization work (Issue #115) may have affected dependency loading
- Multiple related issues suggest systematic sourcing pattern problems

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Blocker Resolution (Issue #124)
- [ ] **Step 1**: Locate exact line 235 in hybrid-monitor.sh causing the error
  - Trace the function call that leads to `load_system_config`
  - Identify which script or function is missing the config-loader import
  - Verify config-loader.sh contains the required functions

- [ ] **Step 2**: Apply targeted fix for hybrid-monitor.sh
  - Add proper `source "$SCRIPT_DIR/utils/config-loader.sh"` before config calls
  - Ensure sourcing happens early enough in the script execution
  - Follow existing patterns from working scripts in the codebase

- [ ] **Step 3**: Verify the core fix works
  - Test: `./src/hybrid-monitor.sh --test-mode 5 --debug` runs without errors
  - Confirm configuration loading works correctly
  - Validate monitoring functionality is restored

### Phase 2: Related Dependency Issues (Issues #127, #128)
- [ ] **Step 4**: Fix setup-wizard.sh logging issue (Issue #127)
  - Move logging module source before any log_debug calls
  - Add proper error handling for missing logging utilities  
  - Test: `./src/setup-wizard.sh --dry-run` works without errors

- [ ] **Step 5**: Fix task queue logging dependencies (Issue #128)
  - Audit src/queue/cache.sh and src/task-queue.sh for missing log imports
  - Add systematic logging module loading pattern
  - Ensure proper fallback when logging functions unavailable

- [ ] **Step 6**: Implement consistent module loading pattern
  - Create standardized utility loading approach
  - Document proper sourcing order for future scripts
  - Add validation to catch missing dependencies early

### Phase 3: Testing & Production Readiness
- [ ] **Step 7**: Comprehensive core functionality testing
  - Test hybrid monitoring in isolated tmux session (safe testing)
  - Verify usage limit detection patterns work correctly
  - Confirm task automation features are functional
  - Test continuous monitoring mode stability

- [ ] **Step 8**: Integration testing for live deployment
  - Test setup wizard works for new installations
  - Verify task queue operations function properly
  - Confirm all critical error messages are resolved
  - Validate system can handle real usage limit scenarios

- [ ] **Step 9**: Regression testing and cleanup
  - Ensure recent array optimizations (Issue #115) still work
  - Verify no performance degradation from dependency fixes
  - Test edge cases (missing config files, permission issues)
  - Clean up any debug/test artifacts

## Fortschrittsnotizen

**2025-09-09 - Initial Analysis**:
- âœ… Confirmed Issue #124 still exists despite previous "completion"
- âœ… Identified this as the critical blocker for live deployment  
- âœ… Confirmed hybrid-monitor.sh completely non-functional
- âœ… Found related dependency issues (#127, #128) affecting system stability

**2025-09-09 - CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED & COMPLETED**:
- âœ… **Issue #124 RESOLVED**: Fixed chicken-and-egg dependency loading in hybrid-monitor.sh
  - Moved `load_dependencies()` before `load_configuration()` in main()
  - Reordered logging module to load first in dependency array
  - Added conditional logging during module loading process
- âœ… **Issue #127 RESOLVED**: Fixed setup-wizard.sh logging calls before sourcing
  - Moved logging.sh sourcing to top of script (after SCRIPT_DIR detection)
  - Removed duplicate logging module loading later in file
- âœ… **Issue #128 RESOLVED**: Fixed task queue logging dependencies  
  - Added `load_logging()` call before any log functions in `load_queue_modules()`
