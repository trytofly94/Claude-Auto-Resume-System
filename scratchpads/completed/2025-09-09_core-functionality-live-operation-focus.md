# Core Functionality Focus: Live Operation Essentials for Claude Auto-Resume System

**Created**: 2025-09-09
**Type**: Enhancement/Focus
**Estimated Effort**: Large
**Related Issue**: User Request - Focus on Main Functionality for Live Operation
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Essential for production readiness

## Context & Goal

Focus ONLY on main functionality needed for the Claude Auto-Resume system to work in live operation. The user specifically prioritizes:
1. **Task automation capabilities** - Core system must reliably execute automated workflows
2. **Critical usage limit detection** - Must detect and handle Claude being "blocked until xpm/am"
3. **Essential core operation** - Avoid unnecessary features, focus on what's needed for production
4. **Safe tmux testing** - Can test in new tmux session without killing existing servers

**Current System State Analysis**:
- Branch: `feature/issue-115-array-optimization` with recent array optimization work
- Modified files indicate recent work on documentation and testing
- System reports 10 pending tasks in global queue
- claunch integration shows occasional startup failures (exit code 1) but graceful fallback works
- Core hybrid monitoring system is functional after Issue #124 resolution

## Requirements

### CORE FUNCTIONALITY (Essential for Live Operation)
- [ ] **Robust Usage Limit Detection**: Precise detection of "blocked until xpm/am" patterns
- [ ] **Automated Task Recovery**: Reliable recovery and continuation after usage limits
- [ ] **Session Management**: Stable claunch/tmux session handling without killing existing sessions
- [ ] **Task Queue Processing**: Automated task execution from queue during available periods
- [ ] **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of interruptions and failures
- [ ] **Live Monitoring**: Continuous operation without manual intervention

### OUT-OF-SCOPE (Avoiding Feature Bloat)
- ‚ùå Advanced UI enhancements
- ‚ùå Complex reporting systems
- ‚ùå Non-essential integrations
- ‚ùå Documentation generation features
- ‚ùå Development utilities beyond core needs

## Investigation & Analysis

### Current Core Components Status

**‚úÖ FUNCTIONAL (Ready for Live Use)**:
- **Hybrid Monitor**: `src/hybrid-monitor.sh` - Main monitoring loop works
- **Task Queue Core**: Basic task processing and management operational
- **Usage Limit Recovery**: `src/usage-limit-recovery.sh` - Basic detection exists
- **Session Management**: Graceful fallback from claunch to direct mode works
- **Error Classification**: `src/error-classification.sh` - Basic error handling in place

**üîÑ NEEDS OPTIMIZATION (Critical for Live Operation)**:
- **claunch Integration**: Startup failures reduce automation reliability
- **Usage Limit Pattern Detection**: May not catch all "blocked until xpm/am" patterns
- **Task Automation Flow**: Queue processing during recovery periods needs enhancement
- **Session Recovery**: Recovery after usage limits could be more robust

**üîç REQUIRES ANALYSIS**:
- **Live Performance**: Real-world usage limit detection patterns
- **Production Stability**: Long-running session management
- **Resource Management**: Memory/CPU usage during continuous operation

### Prior Work Analysis

**Completed Related Work**:
- Issue #115: Array optimization (performance improvements)
- Issue #124: Config loader fixes (hybrid-monitor now functional)
- Issue #134: claunch integration improvements (in progress, high priority)
- Task queue architecture is established with global/local support

**Key Finding**: System architecture is solid, focus needed on reliability and automation robustness.

  - Test complete workflow: task queue ‚Üí usage limit ‚Üí recovery ‚Üí resume
  - Validate system handles multiple consecutive usage limits
  - Test long-running operation (hours/days) stability
  - Verify no memory leaks or resource accumulation

- [ ] **Step 9**: Production readiness validation
  - Test in isolated tmux session without affecting existing work
  - Validate all core functionality works end-to-end
  - Check system handles edge cases gracefully
  - Ensure monitoring and logging provide operational visibility

### Phase 4: Core Functionality Verification
