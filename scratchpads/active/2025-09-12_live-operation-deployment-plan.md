# Live Operation Deployment Plan - Final Implementation

**Created**: 2025-09-12
**Type**: Core System Deployment
**Estimated Effort**: Small
**Related Issue**: Final deployment for live Claude Auto-Resume operation
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Ready for production deployment

## Context & Goal

The Claude Auto-Resume System has completed its development phases with all core components functional. Analysis shows:
- ✅ **18 pending tasks** ready for automated processing
- ✅ **Critical readonly variable fixes** completed (previous scratchpads confirm resolution)
- ✅ **Core infrastructure validated** - hybrid-monitor.sh, task-queue.sh, session-manager.sh all working
- ✅ **No active background processes** - clean slate for deployment
- ✅ **Enhanced usage limit detection** already implemented in usage-limit-recovery.sh

**Goal**: Deploy the system for live operation with focus on task automation and robust usage limit handling.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality (MUST HAVE)
- [ ] **Task Automation Engine** - Process all 18 pending tasks automatically
- [ ] **Usage Limit Detection & Recovery** - Handle pm/am blocking patterns with proper waiting
- [ ] **Safe tmux Integration** - Create new sessions without disrupting existing ones (s000-s012)
- [ ] **Continuous Operation** - Run unattended until all tasks complete or usage limits require waiting
- [ ] **Simple Activation** - One-command startup for live deployment

### Quality Assurance (ESSENTIAL)
- [ ] **System Validation** - Verify all components load and function correctly
- [ ] **Resource Management** - Ensure no memory leaks or excessive resource usage
- [ ] **Error Recovery** - Graceful handling of unexpected failures
- [ ] **Progress Monitoring** - Clear visibility into task processing status

## Investigation & Analysis

### System Status Assessment
**Current State Analysis**:
- **Task Queue**: 18 pending tasks (up from 15-16 in previous scratchpads)
- **Background Processes**: 0 running (clean slate - no interference from old failed processes)
- **Core Components**: All validated as functional in previous testing
- **Recent Work**: Critical system activation completed in recent scratchpads

**Prior Work Review**:
- `2025-09-11_critical-system-activation-live-operation.md` - System successfully unblocked
- `2025-09-11_core-automation-priority-implementation.md` - Comprehensive enhancement plan
- Multiple completed scratchpads showing robust development and testing
- Recent commits indicate system stability and array optimizations

**Key Insights from Prior Work**:
- Readonly variable conflicts were the main blocker - now resolved
- Usage limit detection patterns already enhanced in existing code
- Task queue system fully functional with modular architecture
- System tested successfully in isolated environments

### Technical Architecture Validation

**Core Components Status**:
- `src/hybrid-monitor.sh` (76KB) - Main orchestrator with comprehensive functionality
- `src/usage-limit-recovery.sh` (32KB) - Enhanced pm/am pattern detection already implemented
- `src/task-queue.sh` (28KB) - Fully functional queue management
- `src/session-manager.sh` (76KB) - Session lifecycle management (readonly issues fixed)
- All utility modules in `src/utils/` and `src/queue/` directories present

**Dependencies Validated** (from prior scratchpads):
- Claude CLI: Available and functional
- claunch v0.0.4: Installed and integrated
- tmux: Available for session persistence
- All Unix tools (jq, curl, etc.): Confirmed working

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Validation (5 minutes)
- [ ] **Step 1.1**: Verify system components
  ```bash
  # Quick system health check
  ./src/hybrid-monitor.sh --help  # Verify main script loads
  ./src/task-queue.sh status      # Confirm 18 pending tasks
  shellcheck src/hybrid-monitor.sh src/usage-limit-recovery.sh src/session-manager.sh
  ```

- [ ] **Step 1.2**: Test core functionality in isolated environment
  ```bash
  # Create isolated test session
  tmux new-session -d -s claude-deployment-test-$(date +%s)
  
  # Test basic operation (5-minute test mode)
  ./src/hybrid-monitor.sh --queue-mode --test-mode 300 --debug
  
  # Verify usage limit detection patterns
  grep -n "blocked until\|try again at" src/usage-limit-recovery.sh
  ```

### Phase 2: Live Operation Deployment (10 minutes)
- [ ] **Step 2.1**: Create deployment session
  ```bash
  # Start dedicated live operation session
  tmux new-session -d -s claude-auto-resume-live \
    "./src/hybrid-monitor.sh --queue-mode --continuous --debug"
  
  # Monitor startup and initial task processing
  tmux capture-pane -t claude-auto-resume-live -p
  ```

- [ ] **Step 2.2**: Monitor task automation
  ```bash
  # Continuous status monitoring (separate terminal)
  watch -n 30 "./src/task-queue.sh status"
  
  # Log monitoring for usage limit detection
  tail -f logs/hybrid-monitor.log | grep -E "(usage.limit|blocked.until|waiting.until)"
  ```

### Phase 3: Operation Validation (15 minutes)
- [ ] **Step 3.1**: Verify task processing
  - Monitor task count decreasing from 18 pending
  - Confirm claunch integration executing tasks
  - Validate task completion detection working

- [ ] **Step 3.2**: Test usage limit handling
  - Verify system detects Claude CLI usage limits
  - Confirm proper pm/am time calculations
  - Test countdown display and automatic resumption

- [ ] **Step 3.3**: Validate continuous operation
  - Ensure system runs without manual intervention
  - Verify session persistence across any temporary disconnections
  - Confirm resource usage remains stable

### Phase 4: Production Readiness (5 minutes)
- [ ] **Step 4.1**: Create simple activation script
  ```bash
  # Create one-command deployment script
  cat > start-claude-auto-resume.sh << 'EOF'
  #!/usr/bin/env bash
  set -euo pipefail
  
  echo "🚀 Starting Claude Auto-Resume Live Operation"
  echo "📊 Tasks pending: $(./src/task-queue.sh status 2>/dev/null | jq -r '.pending // "Unknown"')"
  echo ""
  
  # Check if session already exists
  if tmux has-session -t claude-auto-resume-live 2>/dev/null; then
      echo "⚠️  Session 'claude-auto-resume-live' already exists"
      echo "🔍 Attach with: tmux attach -t claude-auto-resume-live"
      exit 1
  fi
  
  # Start live operation
  tmux new-session -d -s claude-auto-resume-live \
      "./src/hybrid-monitor.sh --queue-mode --continuous"
  
  echo "✅ Live operation started successfully!"
  echo "📺 Monitor: tmux attach -t claude-auto-resume-live"
  echo "📊 Status: ./src/task-queue.sh status"
  echo "🛑 Stop: tmux kill-session -t claude-auto-resume-live"
  EOF
  
  chmod +x start-claude-auto-resume.sh
  ```

- [ ] **Step 4.2**: Document monitoring commands
  ```bash
  # Create quick reference for live operation
  cat > live-operation-commands.md << 'EOF'
  # Claude Auto-Resume Live Operation Commands
  
  ## Start System
  ./start-claude-auto-resume.sh
  
  ## Monitor Status
  ./src/task-queue.sh status                    # Task queue status
  tmux capture-pane -t claude-auto-resume-live -p  # Live output
  tail -f logs/hybrid-monitor.log               # Detailed logs
  
  ## Control System
  tmux attach -t claude-auto-resume-live        # Attach to session
  tmux kill-session -t claude-auto-resume-live  # Stop system
  
  ## Emergency Commands
  ps aux | grep hybrid-monitor                  # Check processes
  ./src/task-queue.sh list                      # View task details
  EOF
  ```

- Basic pm/am formats: "blocked until 3pm", "try again at 9am"
- 24-hour formats: "blocked until 15:30", "retry at 21:00"
- Duration patterns: "retry in 2 hours", "wait 30 minutes"
- General limit patterns: "usage limit", "rate limit", "quota exceeded"

### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Quick health check
./src/hybrid-monitor.sh --help && ./src/task-queue.sh status

# Test deployment (5 minutes)
tmux new-session -d -s test "./src/hybrid-monitor.sh --queue-mode --test-mode 300"

# Live deployment
./start-claude-auto-resume.sh

# Monitor operation
watch -n 30 "./src/task-queue.sh status"
tmux attach -t claude-auto-resume-live
```

### Emergency Procedures
```bash
# Stop system gracefully
tmux kill-session -t claude-auto-resume-live

# Force stop if needed
pkill -f hybrid-monitor.sh

# Check for stuck processes
ps aux | grep -E "(hybrid-monitor|claunch)" | grep -v grep

# Reset if needed
./src/task-queue.sh clear-locks  # If file locks become stale
```
