# Core Automation & Usage Limit Enhancement - Live Operation Focus

**Created**: 2025-09-11
**Type**: Feature Enhancement & Core Functionality
**Estimated Effort**: Medium
**Related Issue**: User Request - "Focus on main functionality, automate tasks, handle usage limit blocking properly"

## Context & Goal

Enhance the Claude Auto-Resume System's core functionality to be robust for live operation, with specific focus on:
1. **Task Automation** - Automatic processing of the 15 pending tasks without manual intervention
2. **Enhanced Usage Limit Detection** - Robust detection and handling when Claude is blocked until specific times (xpm/am)
3. **Live Operation Readiness** - System runs unattended and handles real-world scenarios properly

**Current Status**: 15 pending tasks ready for processing, multiple background monitors running, core system functional but needs enhanced usage limit handling.

## Requirement Analysis

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Enhanced Usage Limit Detection Engine
```bash
# Enhance src/usage-limit-recovery.sh with robust patterns
vim src/usage-limit-recovery.sh

# Key improvements:
# - Expanded regex patterns for various time formats
# - Smart timezone-aware timestamp calculation
# - Enhanced countdown display with progress indicators
# - Better error handling for malformed time strings
```

**Enhanced Time Pattern Detection**:
```bash
# Support patterns like:
# "blocked until 3pm"
# "try again at 9am"  
# "available tomorrow at 2:30pm"
# "usage limit exceeded, retry at 15:30"
# "please wait until 21:00"
```

**Smart Timestamp Calculation**:
```bash
# Handle scenarios:
# - Same day (current time 2pm, blocked until 3pm)
# - Next day (current time 11pm, blocked until 9am)
# - Explicit date references ("tomorrow at 2pm")
# - Timezone considerations
```

### Step 2: Task Automation Engine Optimization
```bash
# Optimize hybrid-monitor.sh for robust task processing
vim src/hybrid-monitor.sh

# Key enhancements:
# - Process all 15 pending tasks efficiently
# - Real-time progress monitoring
# - Intelligent error recovery
# - Resource usage optimization
```

**Task Processing Enhancements**:
```bash
# Task execution pipeline:
# 1. Load pending tasks (15 available)
# 2. Execute with claunch integration
# 3. Monitor progress with real-time status
# 4. Handle usage limits with enhanced detection
# 5. Update queue state persistently
# 6. Continue until all tasks completed
```

### Step 3: Live Operation Validation
```bash
# Test in new tmux session (safe isolation)
tmux new-session -d -s claude-live-test

# Start enhanced monitoring
./src/hybrid-monitor.sh --queue-mode --continuous --enhanced-usage-limits

# Monitor task progression
./src/task-queue.sh monitor 0 300  # 5-minute continuous monitoring

3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Test each improvement incrementally
4. **Live Scenario Simulation**: Simulate real-world usage limit scenarios

### Success Validation
```bash
# 1. All 15 tasks processed successfully
./src/task-queue.sh status | jq '.completed == 15'

# 2. Enhanced usage limit detection works
# (Test with simulated pm/am blocking scenarios)

# 3. Unattended operation capability
# System runs for 30+ minutes without intervention

# 4. Resource stability
ps aux | grep hybrid-monitor  # Should show stable processes
```
