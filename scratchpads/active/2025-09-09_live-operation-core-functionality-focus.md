# Live Operation Core Functionality Focus - Essential Production Readiness

**Created**: 2025-09-09
**Type**: Critical Production Enhancement
**Estimated Effort**: Large
**Related Context**: User directive - "Focus on main functionality! Nothing not necessary for live operation."

## Context & Goal

**CRITICAL USER REQUIREMENTS**:
1. **Automated task handling must work** - Core automation capabilities
2. **Detection and handling of "blocked until xpm/am" is critical** - Robust usage limit detection
3. **Focus ONLY on main functionality** - Avoid unnecessary features
4. **Safe testing without killing existing tmux sessions** - Non-destructive testing approach

**Current System Assessment**: Branch `feature/issue-115-array-optimization` with functional hybrid monitoring system, but gaps in production-ready automated task handling and robust usage limit detection.

## Requirements

### CORE FUNCTIONALITY (Essential for Live Operation)
- [ ] **Enhanced "blocked until xpm/am" Detection**: Robust pattern matching for all usage limit variations
- [ ] **Automated Task Queue Processing**: Reliable task execution during available periods  
- [ ] **Session Recovery Without Disruption**: Safe session management preserving existing tmux sessions
- [ ] **Live Monitoring Loop**: Continuous operation with intelligent wait periods
- [ ] **Error Recovery & Resilience**: Graceful handling of interruptions and edge cases

### OUT OF SCOPE (Non-essential for live operation)
- ‚ùå Advanced UI features
- ‚ùå Complex reporting systems
- ‚ùå Non-critical integrations
- ‚ùå Development utilities beyond core needs

## Investigation & Analysis

### Prior Art Research Results

**Relevant Completed Work**:
- `2025-09-09_core-functionality-live-operation-focus.md` - Previous analysis of same requirements
- `2025-09-01_smart-task-completion-detection.md` - Task automation infrastructure 
- `2025-08-25_task-execution-engine-implementation.md` - Core execution engine

**Current Implementation Status**:

**‚úÖ FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS**:
- **Hybrid Monitor**: `src/hybrid-monitor.sh` - Main monitoring loop operational
- **Basic Usage Limit Detection**: Patterns for "usage limit reached", "rate limit" exist (lines 658-674)
- **Task Queue Core**: `src/task-queue.sh` v2.0.0 with modular architecture
- **Session Management**: `src/session-manager.sh` with recovery capabilities
- **claunch Integration**: Graceful fallback from claunch to direct mode

**üî• CRITICAL GAPS FOR LIVE OPERATION**:
- **"blocked until xpm/am" Pattern Robustness**: Current pattern `"blocked until [0-9]\+[ap]m"` may miss variations
- **Automated Task Execution**: Queue processing during recovery periods needs verification
- **Production Session Management**: Need safe testing approach without disrupting existing sessions
- **Live Performance Validation**: Real-world usage patterns untested

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enhanced Usage Limit Detection (CRITICAL)
- [ ] **Robust "blocked until" Pattern Matching**
  - Extend pattern matching in `src/hybrid-monitor.sh` lines 674+
  - Test patterns: "blocked until 3pm", "blocked until 11am", "blocked until 9:30pm"
  - Add timezone handling for "blocked until X UTC" cases
  - Implement fuzzy matching for variations ("available again at", "try again at")

- [ ] **Usage Limit Detection Validation**
  - Create test cases with real Claude CLI output samples
  - Validate detection accuracy across different message formats
  - Ensure no false positives from normal command outputs

### Phase 2: Automated Task Processing (CRITICAL) 
- [ ] **Queue Processing During Available Periods**
  - Verify task execution triggers correctly after usage limit recovery
  - Implement task retry logic for failed executions
  - Add task priority handling during limited availability windows

- [ ] **Session State Management**
  - Enhance session state tracking in `src/session-manager.sh`
  - Implement session health checks before task execution
  - Add context preservation across usage limit cycles

### Phase 3: Safe Testing & Validation (ESSENTIAL)
- [ ] **Non-Destructive Test Environment**
  - Create isolated tmux session testing: `tmux new-session -d -s claude-test-$(date +%s)`
  - Implement test mode with simulated usage limits (existing `--test-mode` enhancement)
  - Add validation scripts that don't interfere with production sessions

- [ ] **Live Operation Readiness Checks**
  - Create system readiness validation script
  - Test complete automation cycle: detection ‚Üí wait ‚Üí recovery ‚Üí task execution
  - Validate against real usage limit scenarios

### Phase 4: Production Deployment (FINAL)
- [ ] **Configuration Optimization**
  - Optimize check intervals for production use
  - Configure appropriate backoff strategies
  - Set production-ready logging levels

- [ ] **Deployment Validation**
  - Full integration test in production-like environment  
  - Monitor first 24-hour operational cycle
  - Document operational procedures

## Progress Notes

**Initial Analysis Complete**: Current codebase has solid foundation but needs production hardening specifically for:
1. More robust usage limit pattern detection
2. Verified automated task processing
3. Safe operational procedures

**Key Risk Areas**:
- Usage limit detection false negatives could break automation
- Session management errors could disrupt existing work
- Insufficient testing could cause production issues

## Resources & References

### Core Files for Modification:
- `src/hybrid-monitor.sh` - Usage limit detection enhancement (lines 658-674)
- `src/usage-limit-recovery.sh` - Recovery logic optimization
- `src/task-queue.sh` - Queue processing reliability
- `src/session-manager.sh` - Safe session management

### Testing Approach:
```bash
# Safe testing without disrupting existing sessions
tmux new-session -d -s "claude-test-$(date +%s)"
./src/hybrid-monitor.sh --test-mode 30 --session-name "claude-test-$(date +%s)"
```

### Validation Commands:
```bash
# Check existing sessions (don't kill)
tmux list-sessions | grep -v claude-test

# Test usage limit detection
echo "You are blocked until 3pm" | grep -E "blocked until [0-9]+[ap]m"

# Verify queue processing
./src/task-queue.sh status
```

## Completion Checklist

- [ ] Enhanced "blocked until xpm/am" pattern detection implemented and tested
- [ ] Automated task queue processing verified with real scenarios  
- [ ] Safe testing procedures established and documented
- [ ] Production readiness validation completed
- [ ] System deployed and operational for 24+ hours successfully
