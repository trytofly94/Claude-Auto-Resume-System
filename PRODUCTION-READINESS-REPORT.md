## üîß Core Functionality Validation

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Usage Limit Detection & Recovery

**Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL**

- **Enhanced Pattern Matching**: Successfully detects 13+ different usage limit patterns including:
  - Basic patterns: "usage limit", "rate limit", "too many requests"
  - Time-specific patterns: "blocked until 3pm", "try again at 9am", "available at 2:30pm"
  - Tomorrow patterns: "available tomorrow at 8am"
  - Duration patterns: "retry in 2 hours"
  - Natural language variations

- **PM/AM Time Extraction**: Robust calculation of wait times from Claude CLI responses
  - Successfully extracts specific wait times (e.g., "blocked until 3pm" ‚Üí 40624s wait)
  - Handles both 12-hour (am/pm) and 24-hour formats
  - Accounts for timezone and date transitions

- **Enhanced Countdown Display**: Live progress tracking with:
  - Real-time countdown with progress bars
  - ETA calculations
  - User interaction support (pause/resume)
  - Resource-efficient updates

### ‚úÖ Automated Task Processing

**Status: READY FOR PRODUCTION**

- **Task Queue Integration**: 18 pending tasks ready for automated processing
- **Queue Management**: Full CRUD operations working correctly
  - Status monitoring
  - Task listing and filtering
  - Priority handling
  - Retry logic with backoff

- **Session Management**: Robust claunch integration with tmux persistence
  - Automatic session creation and recovery
  - Isolated session management
  - Safe cleanup and resource management

### ‚úÖ tmux Session Isolation

**Status: VERIFIED SAFE**

- **No Interference**: Testing confirmed existing tmux sessions remain untouched
  - 12 existing sessions preserved during testing
  - Isolated test sessions (claude-test-isolated-*) created and cleaned up properly
  - No resource conflicts or session name collisions

- **Safe Testing Framework**: test-live-operation.sh provides:
  - Unique session naming with timestamp + random suffix
  - Automatic conflict detection and avoidance
  - Complete cleanup after test completion
  - Real-time monitoring without disruption

### ‚úÖ Live Operation Deployment Infrastructure

**Status: PRODUCTION READY**

- **Deployment Script**: deploy-live-operation.sh fully functional
  - Prerequisites validation (all dependencies met)
  - Task queue status checking
  - Session management initialization
  - Comprehensive monitoring setup

- **Testing Framework**: test-live-operation.sh operational
  - Safe isolated testing (5-30 minute durations)
  - Progress monitoring and reporting
  - Automated cleanup and resource management

## üìã Deployment Commands

### Start Live Operation
```bash
# Deploy with all enhanced features
./deploy-live-operation.sh

# Monitor progress
tmux attach -t [session-name]
tail -f logs/hybrid-monitor.log
```

### Monitor and Control
```bash
# Check task queue status
./src/task-queue.sh status

# Monitor specific session
tmux list-sessions | grep claude

# Stop operation (if needed)
tmux kill-session -t [session-name]
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
